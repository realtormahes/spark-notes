2 Types stream processing model

  1. Record-at-a-time model : The record-at-a-time model does what it sounds like; 
                              it immediately processes each piece of input data as it arrives. 
                              As a result, this model provides the lowest possible latency
                              
  2. Micro Batching         : The micro-batching model waits and accumulates a small batch of input data 
                              based on a configurable batching interval and then processes each batch in parallel. 
                              It is fairly obvious that the micro-batching model canâ€™t provide the same level of latency 
                              as the other model.
